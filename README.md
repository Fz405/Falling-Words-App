Falling words

* how much time was invested (within the given limit)  
Honestly speaking I took 5 days to complete this task because I used kotlin coroutines(new for me) and kotlin.

* how was the time distributed (concept, model layer, view(s), game mechanics)  
First I deeply studied about project then made structure and implement code. In 1st 3 days I made concept, implement model, get data from retrofit 
and then I merge some coding from github in my code because of shortage of time and to save time.

* decisions made to solve certain aspects of the game  
I simply made app stepwise So every step was clear to me.

* decisions made because of restricted time 
Due to restricted time I merged some code from github project in my code. Specially view and counterdown timer coding but I updated some of 
that code according to new standards of coding.

* what would be the first thing to improve or add if there had been more time  
If I had more time then I would use kotlin coroutines on all functions instead of getting it from github to make it more efficient. I just used kotlin coroutines to get retrofit
Api as well as to get random array of words. I also wanted to make UI in JetPack compose which I recently learnt but due to time constraints I did not apply that.
